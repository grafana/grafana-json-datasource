# Changelog

## 1.3.6 (2023-05-30)

- **Chore**: Docs update

## 1.3.5 (2023-04-05)

- **Security**: Recently, A third party researcher (Alessio Della Libera of **Snyk Research Team**) discovered and privately disclosed to us a stored XSS vulnerability in the Grafana-maintained `marcusolsson-json-datasource` plugin also known as “JSON API plugin” .

Users with the editor role could perform a stored XSS attack against other viewers, editors, and administrators by including a specially crafted javascript statement in the `field` extractor in queries to the marcusolsson-json-datasource plugin. This resulted in XSS against anyone viewing a panel configured to query the datasource with a malicious query.

This vulnerability worked because the `marcusolsson-json-datasource` plugin uses the `jsonpath-plus` library to evaluate editor-supplied jsonpath expressions. In its default configuration (which we used), this library is an XSS vector, as the JSONPath spec allows for embedded subexpressions, which `jsonpath-plus` implements as arbitrary javascript expressions.

In order to mitigate this vulnerability, we now supply a configuration parameter to `jsonpath-plus` which forbids the evaluation of subexpressions; it is important to note that this change may **break** existing JSONPath queries that rely on filter or eval expressions.

If your dashboards currently rely on JSONPath queries containing subexpressions, there are a few potential migration paths:

1. For simple queries that use subexpressions for indexing/slicing, it may be possible to rewrite the query without a subexpressions for instance `[(@.length-1)]` can also be represented as `[:-1]`.
2. For more complex queries, we suggest switching to the [`jsonata` language](http://docs.jsonata.org/simple), which the plugin also supports. This language has similar features to JSONPath, including support for filter expressions (called “predicates” in the documentation).
3. If changing your existing queries isn’t feasible, the community plugin [“Infinity”](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/yesoreyeram-infinity-datasource/) supports JSONPath expressions, including filters and subexpressions if used with the `backend` parser option. Please note that Infinity is community supported plugin.

## 0.9.0 (2021-02-01)

[Full changelog](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-json-datasource/compare/v0.8.0...v0.9.0)

**BREAKING CHANGE:** Query parameters set by the query editor no longer overrides the data source config, to match how headers are handled in the Grafana proxy. This establishes the convention that any configuration made by an administrator should have higher priority.

**IMPORTANT:** This release contains many new changes that touches several aspects of the plugin. **Make sure that you back up your dashboards before updating your plugin.**

This release introduces a new query editor that gives more control of the request.

- Support for both GET and POST methods
- Support for request bodies (when using POST)
- Support for headers

It introduces a new key value editor for query parameters and headers, as well as a Monaco-based editor for editing the request body with syntax highlighting.

This release deprecates the `queryString` property in the query model, in favor of the new `params`. The query string config _should_ be backwards-compatible (and forward-compatible) with previous versions, but make sure to back up your dashboard before upgrading.
